- **Category Filter**: Allow users to filter games by categories such as action, adventure, puzzle, etc.
- **Interactive Interface**: Provide a user-friendly interface to browse and download games.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for implementing functionality.
- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the web pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

## API Integration

This project uses Axios to fetch game data from an external API. You will need to replace `API_ENDPOINT` in the code with the actual API endpoint URL. Here's how to integrate the API:

1. **Get API Endpoint**: Sign up on a game API provider (e.g., [GameAPI.com](https://gameapi.com/)).
2. **Replace API Endpoint**: In the codebase, replace `API_ENDPOINT` with the actual API endpoint URL.

```javascript
import axios from "axios";
const key="18d8dc115d954615a6fe8522598e8a97"
const axioCreate= axios.create({
    baseURL: "https://api.rawg.io/api",
    // params: {
    //   key: "18d8dc115d954615a6fe8522598e8a97",
    // },
  });
  
const getPopularGame=axioCreate.get('/games?key='+key)
const getMovieDetails=(id)=>axioCreate.get('/games/'+id+'/movies')
const getGameListByGenreId=(id)=>axioCreate.get('/games?key='+key+'&genres='+id)
```
